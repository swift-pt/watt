Watt is an iOS mobile app developed for the TP-Link's Smart Plugs and Smart Lamps, that allows you to set cost for each kilowatt(kW) and by doing this you have control of the cost in each device. Also, add support for voice actions using the "Hey Siri".

With this page of GitHub, I hope to develop a small community to report problems with the application and think of solutions.

# Roadmap

- [x] Show cumulative energy usage form all devices.
- [x] Show energy consumption by last 30 days, month.
- [x] Show daily cost metrics
- [x] Make it work with HS100
- [x] Night Mode (Option to turn off the led light).
- [x] Show more info about each device (Like real-time consumption, Voltage, wireless signal)
- [x] The ability to reset the stats for when a different appliance/device is plugged in and I want to start fresh.
- [x] Create a concept "Room/Spaces" which will aggregate multiple devices.
- [x] Find a way to give commands to Siri to turn on/off device (maybe using Siri shortcut)
- [ ] Send a weekly email with consumption reports and charts.
- [ ] Add support to TP-Link HS300
- [ ] Export the data to Excel (CSV)
- [ ] Show chart gathering all devices and the total cost.
- [ ] Record the energy consumption hour by hour (background fetch)
- [ ] Show energy consumption by day, bill.
- [ ] The option to define peak and off-peak times and electricity prices.
- [ ] Force reboot, turn Off device then On after 30 seconds turn on again (Helpful for devices like wifi routers connected to the smart plug)
- [ ] Make smart action (like if consumption is lower then specific value turn off(stand-by), or using GPS and when arriving home turn on the light, even use the weather forecast to make action, define amount time before sunset/sunrise action)
- [ ] Make a personalized schedule that  will tell you how much money you will save by turning off your device x hours
- [ ] Set Goals to save energy
- [ ] Implement Haptic Touch
- [ ] Add Artificial Intelligence (IA) to detect and send you push notification when some consumption is not right like: leave the refrigerator door open, washer is done.
- [ ] If you have multiple devices connected to single HS110 use artificial intelligence to detect which devices are turned on and off and how much each one of them is spending.
- [ ] Make android version
